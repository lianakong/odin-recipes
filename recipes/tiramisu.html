    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp marsala wine</li>
        <li>8 oz mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>3 1/2 tbsp matcha powder</li>
        <li>24 ladyfinger cookies</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and equipment.</li>
        <li>In the medium heatproof mixing bowl, add 3 large egg yolks, 2 Tbsp marsala wine, and 3 Tbsp of the ⅓ cup sugar. Start whisking it with a handheld electric mixer.</li>
        <li>In a double boiler saucepan of simmering water, gently cook egg mixture while beating constantly.</li>
        <li>As soon as the egg mixture reaches 160ºF (71ºC), immediately remove the mixing bowl from the saucepan. Set the bowl in the ice bath to quickly stop the cooking. Let it cool for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Soften 8oz of mascarpone cheese in another large bowl, then add and gently fold in egg mixture until smooth.</li>
        <li>Beat the heavy whipping cream in another bowl, gradually adding sugar and whisking until soft peaks form.</li>
        <li>Fold the whipped cream mixture into the mascarpone mixture until well combined.</li>
        <li>To assemble, gather 24 ladyfingers.  One at a time, quickly dip a ladyfinger into the matcha mixture until soaked but not soggy; use a pair of tongs to flip it over to soak the other side. Then, place it on the bottom of an 8 x 8-inch (20 x 20 cm) baking dish. Repeat until you‘ve arranged 2 rows of 6 ladyfingers each.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers in an even layer. Smooth out the surface.</li>
        <li>Create a second layer of cookies, dipping the remaining ladyfingers in the matcha mixture and placing them in 2 neat rows on top of the mascarpone cream layer.</li>
        <li>Top with the remaining cream and smooth out the top. Cover with a sheet of plastic wrap placed directly on the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove your chilled Matcha Tiramisu from the refrigerator and unwrap the plastic. Immediately before serving, dust 2 Tbsp matcha (green tea powder) on top of the tiramisu using a fine-mesh sieve.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! :)</li>
