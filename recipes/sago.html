    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tapioca pearls</li>
        <li>Coconut milk</li>
        <li>Matcha powder</li>
        <li>Fresh strawberries</li>
        <li>Sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>Honey (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 5 cups of water to boil. Once the water boils, reduce the heat to a simmer and add the tapioca pearls.</li>
        <li>Cook the pearls for about 15 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent sticking. After about 15 minutes, the pearls should look translucent. Turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid. Let the pearls sit for another 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the pearls are cooked and turned translucent, strain them through a fine mesh sieve and rinse off the excess starch with cold running water. Fill a separate large bowl with cold water. After rinsing, transfer the cooked pearls to cold water to cool them down. Set aside.</li>
        <li>While the tapioca pearls are cooling down, prepare the matcha-coconut mixture. Pour 1 can of coconut milk into a saucepan or pot. Heat the coconut milk over medium heat until warm.</li>
        <li>Drain the tapioca pearls and add them to coconut milk. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>In a separate small dish or cup, combine matcha powder with hot water. Whisk until no lumps.</li>
        <li>Add matcha to the coconut sago, stir constantly until smooth and well combined. Optionally, add sweetener (honey or sweetened condensed milk) to the sago and mix until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from heat and let Matcha Sago cool down. If you like thicker sago, you can simmer it for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the cooked tapioca pearls and diced strawberries between 4 containers. Here in this recipe I used a 5oz glass cup and I added yogurt for extra topping.</li>
        <li>Drizzle condensed milk in between each layer. Top with more diced strawberries.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! :)</li>
    </ol>
